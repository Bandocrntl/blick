## 1. Information We Collect



When you use **Blick**, the following types of information may be collected:



### 1.1 Data Collected Automatically

We may collect certain information automatically as you interact with the Bot:



- **Discord User ID**: We collect your Discord user ID to identify and interact with you during your use of the Bot.

- **Server Information**: We collect basic server details (such as server ID, name, and roles) to provide functionality like moderation, commands, and more.

- **Command Usage**: We collect data on which commands are used and how frequently to improve the Bot’s features and functionality.

- **Messages**: If you use commands that require sending a message (e.g., `.kick`, `.warn`), the Bot may collect the content of those messages to execute the commands correctly.



### 1.2 Data Collected from Users

Certain features of the Bot may require additional permissions, and we may collect the following:



- **User-generated Content**: If you use features such as `!joke`, `!meme`, or similar, content like images or text generated through the Bot may be logged for functionality purposes.

- **Personal Data**: The Bot does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) unless explicitly provided by the user through commands (e.g., `!userinfo`).

## 2. How We Use the Data



The data collected is used for the following purposes:



- **Bot Functionality**: To provide and enhance features, such as executing commands and providing server moderation.

- **Command Tracking**: To track usage and improve the functionality of the Bot by adding features or optimizing performance.

## 3. Data Retention



We do not retain any user data longer than necessary for the functionality of the Bot. Here’s how long different types of data are stored:



- **Command Logs**: Command usage is stored for a limited time to improve the Bot’s performance and enhance user experience. These logs are generally cleared every 30 days.

- **User-Generated Content**: Any images or data generated through Bot commands are stored temporarily and deleted after the action is completed.



We will not store personal data unless required by law or for the purpose of improving the Bot’s services.

## 4. Data Security



We implement reasonable security measures to protect the data you provide. However, no system is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data. 



- We use encrypted communication protocols (SSL/TLS) to ensure your data is transmitted securely.

- The data we collect is stored on secure servers with limited access.

## 5. Data Sharing



**Blick** does not share or sell any data to third parties. The information collected is used solely for the functionality and improvement of the Bot. However, the following exceptions may apply:



- **Third-Party Services**: If you use certain features of the Bot that rely on third-party APIs (e.g., fetching memes, jokes, or images from external sources), those third-party services may collect data in accordance with their own privacy policies.

- **Legal Compliance**: If required by law or to protect our rights, we may disclose your information to comply with legal obligations, court orders, or other legal processes.
